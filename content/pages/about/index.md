I'm João Marcos (he/him), but some of my dear friends call me Moão.

I don't take myself too seriously, and you shouldn't either!

On trying to be self-aware: I'm a "language person", and I know that's usually referred to as a bad thing. Not sure if I'm willing to force myself otherwise, if I should, or if it matters.

In my understanding, being a "language person" speaks about how much you're passionate about such subject.

And about being too passionate, my job activity is the same as my main hobby, I'd say that's mostly good, but also hard to balance out, sometimes I get worried that I'm too obcessed about programming (and Rust).

I feel like I spend so much time on it, as if I'm _missing out on life_, whatever that means.

Does my life revolve around a single activity?

Anyways, I've been consciously making an effort lately to balance things out, I've been feeling less obcessed, and it's been great so far!
