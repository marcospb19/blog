# The blog

I have a list of post ideas to make, here is a peek at some:

- Ergonomically testing filesystem tree mutation.
- An intuition guide for Quake-like air strafing implementations.
- An understandable example for the fifth derivative.
- How to create a basic RegEx engine.
- Algorithm complexity isn't about "speed".
- FFFFF: Fashioning Fuzzy Finders For Fun.

Just ideas, I have no clear plans for what or when, maybe one post per year? IDK.

# The me

I'm João Marcos (he/him) and some friends call me Moão. I'm 23 and at 17 I wrote my first "Hello World" as I joined college.

Since that, I spent waaay too many nights looking at a text editor.

Last year I became worried about my "programming obsession" and "missing out on life", since that, I've been trying to slow down, I look forward to touch more grass in the future.

Thanks, grass.
