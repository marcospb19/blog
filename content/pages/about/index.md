I'm João (he/him), and some of my dear friends call me Moão.

I don't take myself too seriously, and you shouldn't either.

My blog is AI-free, I'm not against AI usage in general, but I prefer reading texts that are made by human beings, to human beings.

There may be a project that sparks your interest listed at my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/marcospb19).

About trying to be self-aware: I'm a "language person", and I know that's usually referred to as a bad thing. Not sure if I'm willing to force myself otherwise, if I should, or if it matters.

In my understanding, being a "language person" speaks about how much you're passionate about that subject.

And about being passionate, my job "activity" is the same as my main hobby, I'd say that's mostly good, but also hard to balance out, sometimes I get worried that I'm too obcessed about programming.

I feel like I spend so much time on it, as if I'm _missing out on life_, whatever that means.

Does my life revolve around a single activity?

Reflections aside, I'm a happy person that enjoys doing what I do, it is my life, and I'm not against most of the decisions I've been taking so far.

I'm trying to steer my career to somewhere I can feel most accomplished, I'd love to make something that people love, even if it's a small group of people (dev-tools? maybe?).
